Hotel

Customer
----------------------------------------
1. No decision paralysis, keep it simple
2. People want to see the places & know the vibe
3. Specs about rooms are very important[Show more / Show less]
4. Layout: Desktop 3 col, Tab 2 col, Mobile 1 col
	
----------------------------------------
Navbar
===============
	- Stays on the screen at all times
	Two types of desktop nav
		 1. Without booking button, because we are at the top of the page and the booking tray is at the bottom of the screen
		 2.With a booking button, when someone scrolls down the page meaning they want to see the culture/vibe not book just yet

Home
===============
	- Carousel of info/Marketing/pictures of hotel to get people excited, High impact imagery
	- This is common among accomodation websites, usually dislaying images of the location

	- Social proof- Pictures of guests 
	- Promos not on the lading Carousel
